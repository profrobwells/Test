This is one of the more theoretically sophisticated papers I’ve seen while reviewing for JJCHC. The author seems a bit more oriented to literary history and studies — the literature review is focused more on the history of women’s inclusion in literature than the role of media in that dynamic. The method engages with media history more so than the topic. Perhaps the author can expound upon the stakes of this for media history and in particular the history of literary criticism and book reviews within journalistic outlets? There is some gesturing toward this in the conclusion but perhaps that can be brought up a bit more to help structure the paper to underscore the stakes for media historians (as opposed to historians of literature)?

I would be interested to know more about the news media discourse about these two men. Also, what is the role of nationalism and ideas about media control/power?

Theoretical framework is a bit outdated — author should engage with Hallin & Mancini’s updated approach to comparing media systems across country context (Siebert, Peterson and Schramm is a relic of the Cold War and should only be engaged with critically at this point, not as theory to be applied).

There is far too little work on the early history of news radio and I’m glad to see that someone is toiling in this neglected field. I like the that the author is drawing parallels between the development of news radio in the US and UK. That said, there have been media and journalism historians who have written about the history of the BBC and BBC radio in particular. The author does not mention any historiography or literature so it is unclear whether or to what extent they are engaging that literature. What is the intervention here? Also, the author makes no note of method — what primary sources are being analyzed here? Is the author conducting archival research with the BBC papers?

Scripps School of Journalism Ohio University",3,3,2,4,3,"This abstract has a lot of embedded assumptions that need ironing out. Why has the author selected the New York Times, Los Angeles Tribune and Chicago Tribune to study? Why between 1995-2020? Are these really representative of “American collective memory” writ large? Can we truly aggregate collective memory by extrapolating from three newspapers’ framing? Is there evidence that Americans experienced the dropping of the bombs as “collective trauma”? Or is this the author’s normative assumption? What is the evidence of collective trauma? Certainly fear regarding the nuclear age and the possibility of nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union inflicted collective trauma during the Cold War. I’m not sure you can say that of the bombings in Japan, at least not at scale. Can we talk about “American collective trauma” without differentiating between subgroups (ideological, ethnic) within the United States? The topic is interesting but is also well-worn historical debate fodder, familiar to any high school civics or AP US History student. What’s the historiographical intervention here? The author suggests the stakes have to do with stoking nationalism, but that is quite overdetermined in the US context especially between 1995 and 2020 — while nuclear bomb commemorations and films occurred during that period, US nationalist resurgence had more to do with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and domestic right-wing formations like the Tea Party movement and the political stardom of Donald Trump. Perhaps a more effective strategy would be to look at how US papers covered the atomic bomb in the aftermath of the attacks on Japan compared to how US papers compared the same following the Soviet development of nuclear weapons (when the US lost the monopoly on the technology)?","Bauer",NA,"Y"

I also recommend the author consult additional sources on historical methods since humanistic approaches to qualitative research differ from those in the social sciences. Both are valid, but I imagine the author might find more transferable examples in the work of other historians. Finally, the author presents three RQs but one thematic framework, which did not seem to align with all the questions posed.

I encourage the researcher to keep researching connections between 1960s activist and current pro-Palestinian protests. However, this submission lacks many important components that should be included in a RIP. To not bury the lead, my largest issue concerns the absence of a methods discussion. 

While it is clear the author is immersed in the present literature review, a RIP should focus  primarily on the author’s own study as opposed to reviewing literature. While you offer an interesting section on your brief findings, I am left craving details on what you’re examining. For example, the author writes, “My analysis thus far reveals that the coverage relies on and deepens the “processing” of activism identified by Todd Gitlin in his landmark 1980 book The Whole World is Watching.” I don’t know what this analysis entails or what exactly is being analyzed. Coverage from where and by whom? How much coverage was analyzed and what time frame was examined?

I’d like to accept this research because I think it is an important and timely subject. However, without knowing where the information is coming from and how many articles were examined, I feel uneasy accepting it to a conference. 

I’m sharing a research-in-progress formula that was shared with me by a mentor. It has proven to be a successful template for me at this conference and other j-history conferences. The formula goes as follows: Begin with 1-2 paragraphs on historical scene-setting; next, write 1 paragraph specifically addressing the “so what?” factor.  Why does this research matter?; next, 1-2 paragraph on methods. Specify which publications and/or archives you’re examining, why you chose them, and the time frame the material is from; end with 1-2 paragraphs addressing your argument, preliminary findings, and research questions, if applicable.  I hope that you find this formula as useful as I have. 


Again, I would like to encourage the author to keep studying this important subject and I hope to see this research at a future conference.","Walter",NA,"N"
